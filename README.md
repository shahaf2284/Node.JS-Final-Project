# Node.JS-Final-Project
Employee management application

## About
Application of workers in a plastic factory.
The goal is to give employees full access to their shift details and personal information concerning them. Each worker is limited by a daily amount of operations which resets at 8:00 am. I created an entity of a department manager who is different from the other employees in the department even though he has special privileges.

## Working with libraries:
* express 
* cors
* mongoose
* axios

## work with fake server:
All employees are on the site "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"

## how to config:
To config the project you need to Follow the steps:
* first initialization:
  ```sh
  npm init --yes
*  open mongoDB and create Data base on behalf of "FactoryDB", you also can dounlowd the DB from my dirctory DB in github
*  run the project:
  ```sh
  node index.js 
 ```
