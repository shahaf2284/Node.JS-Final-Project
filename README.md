# Node.JS-Final-Project
Employee management application

## About
Application of workers in a plastic factory.
The goal is to give employees full access to their shift details and personal information concerning them. Each worker is limited by a daily amount of operations which resets at 8:00 am. I created an entity of a department manager who is different from the other employees in the department even though he has special privileges.
